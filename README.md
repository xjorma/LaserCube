# State Of Laser Beam
My little tribute to "State of The Art" by Spaceballs, and I believe this is the first demo using a laser display. I also provide a small little c++ example on how to draw with a laser cube without any dependency (Just communicating with osc packet)

Unfortunately the code was writen under tigth deadline. Code quality might be affected (This is an 
euphemism :) )

option:

-osc to use an external osc clock

-laser to run on laser cube instead of using opengl glut "emulation"

-i intensity Beam intensity in percent
